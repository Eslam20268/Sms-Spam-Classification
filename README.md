Sms-Spam-Classification
This project focuses on classifying SMS messages into Spam or Ham (non-spam) categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

What I Have Done
Collected and included a dataset (spam.csv) containing labeled SMS messages as spam or ham.

Developed a Jupyter Notebook (spam-vs-ham-sms-classification-with-nlp.ipynb) that:

Loads and explores the dataset.

Preprocesses the text data using NLP methods (such as cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization).

Builds and trains a machine learning model to classify messages.

Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

Published the project publicly on GitHub so others can view and use the code.
